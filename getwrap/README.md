# Introduction
--------------
Command line utility to add to ge.tt

Goal:
------
Firstly, to exercise my skills in interacting with API's. This wrapper script
helps us to add anything you would want via command line. The script also provides an option of zipping uploads

Usage:
------
Usage: getwrap.py [-h] [-f [Files [Files ...]]] [-s share\_name] [-t title] [-z] [-i share\_id] [-l]

where,
- '-f' : list of files you want to upload
- '-s' : upload files to a particular share
- '-z' : flag to zip files
- '-l' : list all shares for an account
- '-i' : print information about a share
